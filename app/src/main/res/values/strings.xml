   Important: This agreement is a contract between you and the administrator of this application. Please read it carefully before using.
   \n1. The content, validity and changes of this agreement. The content of this agreement includes the body of the agreement and all rules that have been published by the APP or may be released in the future.
   \nAll rules are an integral part of this agreement and have the same legal effect as the body of the agreement. If you have any questions about the agreement, please contact this APP.
   \nOnly after you agree to all the terms of the agreement and complete the registration process can you become an official user of this site. After you click the "I have read and agreed the User Agreement and Legal Agreement of this APP" button, you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms.
   \nAs long as you use the service from this APP, this agreement will be binding on you. At that time, you should not claim that this agreement is invalid, or request cancellation, on the grounds that you have not read the content of this agreement or obtained the answer to your inquiry by this APP.
   \nYou confirm that the terms of this agreement are a contract that deals with the rights and obligations of both parties and are always valid. If there are other mandatory provisions of the law or special agreements between the two parties, that they shall be regarding to them.
   \nYou undertake to accept and abide by this agreement. If you do not agree with this agreement, you should immediately stop using this APP service.
   \nThis APP has the right to formulate and modify this agreement and / or various rules from time to time as required, and publicize it on this APP platform, without further separate notification to users. Once the changed agreement and rules are published on the website, they will take effect immediately.
   \nIf you do not agree with the relevant changes, you should immediately stop using this APP platform service. Your continued use of the APP platform services indicates that you accept the revised agreement and rules.
   \n2. Keep the device offline, that do not connect it to other devices by any approaches such as cable, mobile network, WIFI, Bluetooth, NFC, etc.
   \n3. Make sure that Private keys, Secret phrase, and Mnemonics are never revealed or lost. Secret phrase or Mnemonics can generate Private keys at any time, but Private keys cannot infer Secret phrase or Mnemonics.
   \n4. When displaying private keys, Secret phrase, or Mnemonic on the screen, ensure that the surrounding area is safe, and there is no other person’s vision, camera, etc.
   \n5. The private key, secret phrase and mnemonic that are used to store assets must be safely backed up more than 2 copies offline, placed separately, and checked regularly.
   \n6. Once the device is lost or hacked, please use the backup private key to transfer the assets to a secure address immediately.
   \n7. When using secret phrase to generate private keys, the secret phrase should be of sufficient length and complexity. It is recommended that more than 40 characters include multiple kinds of characters. Random numbers of a certain length can be added. Do not use famous poems. Remember, you are facing a mass of computers over the world trying to crack private keys.
   \n8. The code that generates private key with secret phrase on this device is open source. You can find it on sign.cash. You can also use some secret phrase to generate private keys online and  compare it with the private keys generated on Cryptosigner with the same secret phrase. By this, you can prevent that Cryptosinger APP provide you leaked private key. Never use the secret phrase of the stored assets for online testing.
   \n9. You can generate a private key or mnemonic in a secure and trusted external device, and import to Cryptosigner by scanning or manual input. The security of this session will depend on the source of the private key and mnemonic and your actions.
   \n10. Again, the private key, Secret phrase, and mnemonic can not be leaked or lost, and the device must be offline, which is the significant meaning of Cryptosinger.
   \n11. This application is not connected to the Internet and does not collect any user and application data. If the data leak occurs, this APP is not responsible for this.</string>
